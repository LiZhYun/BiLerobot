<caption>
    Parallel heterogeneous simulation of the mobile manipulator Fetch robot opening different cabinets of different degrees of freedom, showcasing the ability to simulate different geometries and articulations in one GPU simulation. The robot is controlled by a state-based RL policy trained in 15 minutes on a single 4090 GPU.
